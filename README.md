This repository contains the R code used in the study:

“Comparability of accelerometry outcomes across popular metrics and widespread sensor positions.”

The study investigated how different accelerometry metrics and sensor placements compare across a wide range of activity conditions. 
Participants performed 32 conditions, which were grouped into eight categories (lying, sitting, standing, activities of daily life, climbing stairs, walking, jogging, cycling). 
Analyses included descriptive statistics, correlations, visualizations, and cut-point calculations.
